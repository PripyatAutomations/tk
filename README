Trying to get this working for an initial public release, so excuse the mess!

There's a lot of artifacts here i haven't had time to cleanup or fully integrate...

Edit files in etc/
Run ./build.sh


To start use ./startup.sh
To stop use  ./stop.sh
To cleanup before rebuilding use ./cleanup.sh

--------
* boot.d and init.d really do need merged
