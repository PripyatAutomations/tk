-----------
This is out of date - clone it to somewhere else THEN install to /opt...

Excuse the mess while i clean this up for publication....

This 'must' live at /opt/telekinesis otherwise a lot of editing will be
required... Feel free to submit patches to deal with this in a friendly way!

See INSTALL.d first

Install
-------
*	cd /opt
*	git clone https://github.com/PripyatAutomations/telekinesis.git
*	sudo /opt/telekinesis/install/install.sh

Move /etc/asterisk out of the way and make a symlink to /opt/telekinesis/etc/asterisk
*	sudo mv /etc/asterisk{.,old}
*	sudo ln -s /opt/telekinesis/etc/asterisk /etc/

Edit asterisk configurations.

You'll need to make extension or at least call Statis(telekinesis,${CONTEXT}) to make this work:
*	[telekinesis]
*	exten => 5000,1,NoOp()
*	 same => n,Stasis(telekinesis,${CONTEXT})

You'll need to modify the supplied configurations.

Start up using /opt/telekinesis/init/system-startup.sh then connect to asterisk.

CONFIGURING
-----------
edit /opt/telekinesis/etc/telekinesis.sh

SECURITY
--------
There literally is NONE. Use VPN access to the machine to protect/control access. 0.2 release will address this.

CONTROLLING
-----------
See ari/README.md for information about how to control the station via DTMF
