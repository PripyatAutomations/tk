Clean this mess up! We've cobbled pieces of several of my projects into one tree, now to integrate them cleanly...

* Make the js side wait a brief bit before connecting (setTimeout ..)
* Add auto-reconnect
* Add disconnect button
* cgi-bin has hardcode passwords!
* genconf/baresip-backend.pl hardcoded hostname

-----------
* Packet mode interface using xterm.js

* Directed net (voice) mode similar to irc +m channels
  - Only net control and +v can talk
  - Can "raise hand" to ask for voice during idle timeslot
